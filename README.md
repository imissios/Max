Projects made in Cycling '74's Max.

emersion contains Emersion (2021), a Max 8 project that uses audio-signal processing to metaphorically explore the idea of a mental health "crash", particularly in the context of burnout, and how that personally feels. While it often feels like we can't possibly go any further, sometimes all we need is another person to reach out and to help us emerge out of our rut. This project was created during the height of COVID-19 when isolation and loneliness were major difficulties, which is reflected in the piece.

shipwreckStorm contains Shipwreck Storm (2020), a Max 7 project that experiments with entirely audio-based storytelling, as a way to explore the way our minds process audio in a larger context and put pieces together. 
shipwreckStorm.mp3 is included for a preview of the final audio without needing to use Max.
